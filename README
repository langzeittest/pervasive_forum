Module: Pervasive Forum
Author: Oliver Riesen <oliver@riesen.org>

Shows specified forums in each folder or each subfolder.

In Phorum3 were two corresponding display options for forums called "Show in each
folder" and "Show also in each subfolder".

Tested on version 5.2.7 with "Directory Structure" and "Flat Structure".

|   |   |
|   |   +-- Technics
|   |   |
|   |   +-- Maintenance and repair
